# Project-Module1
The Big Apple is a website created to provide helpful information about education, healthcare, and employment in New York City. This website aims at new permanent residents in NYC; therefore, the website contains basic information that could help immigrants get established. Furthermore, it has sections focused on immigrants' experiences of moving to this city and fun facts about living there.  
 
Moreover, The Big Apple is a module 1 project that demonstrates what I have learned during my first remote learning month. I have built and developed this website using HTML5, CSS to apply design and Javascript to make it dynamic. Therefore, this website has a responsive design that allows the website to works well regardless of screen sizes and includes multimedia elements, images, animation, and links that would take users to other websites. Besides, there is a useful section that would allow immigrants, who want to learn English,  find English for Speakers of Other Languages(ESOL) programs. I created this section using APIs from the NYC Open Data website, and the fetch method. 

Finally, The Big Apple website is my first project using the knowledge that I have acquired about HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript and I know there are many things that can be improved and learned. Thus, feel free to leave some comments and feedback about this website, I would really appreciate it.
